Project to scrape the locations of your
favourite retail brand in India and extract the following information:
Store Name,
Address,
Timings,
Coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) (bonus),
Phone Number.

## BRIEF REPORT -
## Approach:

Identify the website to scrape and the data to extract.

Inspect the HTML code of the website to find the appropriate tags and attributes that contain the data.

Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML code and extract the desired data.

Store the extracted data in a format that can be easily analyzed or used for further processing.

## Challenges:

Identifying the appropriate tags and attributes can be challenging, especially if the HTML code is complex or poorly structured.

Websites may have anti-scraping measures in place that can block your requests or ban your IP address.

Some websites may require authentication or have dynamically generated content that requires additional steps to access.

## How to overcome them:

Use the developer tools in your web browser to inspect the HTML code and identify the tags and attributes. Beautiful Soup also has methods to search for specific tags or attributes, which can be helpful in navigating complex HTML code.

To avoid being blocked, try to mimic human behavior by adding random delays between requests and rotating user agents. You can also use a proxy server to mask your IP address.

If a website requires authentication, you may need to use a library like requests or Selenium to log in before scraping. For dynamically generated content, you may need to use JavaScript rendering or API calls to access the data.

Overall, Beautiful Soup is a powerful tool for web scraping, but it's important to be mindful of ethical considerations and legal restrictions when scraping data from websites. It's also a good practice to check the website's terms of service and robots.txt file to ensure that you're not violating any rules or policies.
